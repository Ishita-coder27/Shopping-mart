# Shopping-mart
In a world where online shopping has become a necessity, managing multiple stores and their inventory can be a challenging task. 
Our goal is to design a system that allows both administrators and customers to interact with a shopping club platform. The system handles the management of shops, articles, and customer purchases. 
The system provides functionalities for managing shops, updating product information, and generating bills for customers while ensuring that the inventory is correctly updated after each transaction.
